Design A uses a grid-based trait selection system, while Design B incorporates sliders for customization. The study used the System Usability Scale (SUS), Customization Complexity Perceived Ease, Task Completion Time, and Perceived Satisfaction to measure usability. Users were given three tasks and were directed through each. Design B outperformed Design A in most metrics, including SUS score, ease of customization, and perceived satisfaction. However, it took slightly longer to complete, indicating that while it provided a richer and more customizable experience, it might be more time-consuming. Design A, while faster and simpler, did not offer as satisfying or flexible an experience.",
